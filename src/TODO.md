Update your subheading with the version we discussed:
  "Full-stack web developer specializing in high-impact marketing sites and interactive web applications. Combining technical expertise with design sensibility to create seamless digital experiences that drive results."
  Add a skills section that's visually compact but informative:

Create a horizontal row of skill categories with expandable details
Use a simple grid of icons with labels for different technologies
Include a visual skill meter that shows relative expertise levels

Improve project labels beyond just "Framer Development":

For Hire.inc: "UI Development & Interactive Components"
For Studioshot: "Responsive Design & Custom Components"

Add a mini "About" or "Expertise" section between your hero and work sections:

Keep it to 2-3 short paragraphs
Highlight your core offerings: UI/UX, front-end development, Framer expertise
Mention your end-to-end capabilities

Consider a "Process" section with simple icons and brief descriptions:

Discovery → Design → Development → Delivery
This showcases your methodical approach without adding much visual weight
```
